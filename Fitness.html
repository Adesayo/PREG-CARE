    <h2>Exercises you can do during pregnancy?</h2>
    <p>Most exercises are safe to perform during pregnancy, as long as you exercise with caution and do not overdo it. The safest and most productive activities are Swimming, Brisk Walking, Indoor Stationary Cycliying, Step or Elliptical Machines, and Low Impact Aerobics.</p>
<h3>Brisk walking</h3>
<p>
If pre-pregnancy exercise levels were low, a quick stroll around the neighborhood is a good way to start.
<br>
This will provide a cardiovascular workout without too much impact on the knees and ankles. It can be done for free, almost anywhere, and at any time during pregnancy.
</p>

<h3>Aerobic exercise</h3>
<p>
Aerobic exercise is any activity that makes your heart beat faster. This includes brisk walking, swimming and various classes that you do to music.
<br>
If you’re new to aerobic exercise, start off slowly and gradually build up to a maximum of four half-hour sessions a week.
</p>

<h3>Cycling</h3>
<p>
Cycling is a great low-impact aerobic exercise. However, as your bump grows, your balance will change, which could mean you are more likely to fall off.
<br>
If you’re used to cycling, you should be safe to carry on, but if you begin to feel less stable than usual it may be best to stay off your bike or switch to a stationary bike until after your baby is born.

Using a stationary exercise bike in the gym or as part of a group session is fine.
</p>

<h3>Strength exercises</h3>
<p>
Strength training exercises are exercises that make your muscles stronger. They include swimming, working with weights, walking uphill and digging the garden.

It’s a good way to keep your muscles toned during pregnancy.
