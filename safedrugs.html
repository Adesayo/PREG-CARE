        <h1>Medications that are safe during pregnancy</h1>
        <p>
          Getting sick when you're pregnant can be scary enough without having to stress about whether popping pills that might ease your symptoms will harm your growing baby. "One of the biggest things my pregnant patients are afraid of is ingesting something that may cause birth defects or negatively impact the baby's development," says Alane Park, M.D., mother of two sons and co-author of The Mommy Docs' Ultimate Guide To Pregnancy and Birth

        <h3 id="cold">Cough and cold</h3>
        <p>
      Cold medications are not well-studied for use during pregnancy. Some doctors suggest trying to wait until after your 12th week to minimize any potential risks to your baby
        </br>
        Safe options include:
   </p>
   <ul class="page-list">
<li>Plain cough syrup, such as Vicks</li>
<li>Dextromethorphan cough syrups</li>
<li>Cough expectorant during the day</li>
<li>Cough suppressant at night</li>
</ul>

        <h3 id="constipation">Constipation</h3>
        <p>
Stool softeners are generally considered safe during pregnancy. Options include Colace or Surfak.
<br/>
Laxatives, like Senokot, Dulcolax, or Milk of Magnesia, may also help, but speak with your doctor before trying any of these medications.
<br/>

Other treatment options for constipation include the following:
</p>
<ul class="page-list">
<li>Drink more water and fluids.</li>
<li>Add more exercise to each day.</li>
<li>Eat more fiber. You can find fiber in fruits and vegetables (with skins, if possible), beans, and whole grains.</li>
</ul>

        <h3 id="pain">Pain or headache relief</h3>
        <p>
Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) is the drug of choice for pain during pregnancy. It’s widely used with very few documented adverse effects.
</p>
        <h3 id="infection">Infections</h3>
        <p>
If you have an infection such as strep throat or an UTI that calls for antibiotics, penicillin is the way to go. "There have never been any birth defects associated with the penicillin family, or any other issues linked to mom or baby," says Dr. Park. However, the tetracycline and doxycycline families of antibiotics have been found to cause discoloration in babies' teeth after the fourth month of pregnancy, because these meds affect the calcification—or the hardening—of their pearly whites. "It's purely a cosmetic thing, but best to avoid those types of antibiotics," says Dr. Park. At the end of the day, if your doctor prescribes any medications while pregnant, rest assured that the drug probably poses far fewer risks than the effects of an untreated illness or infection

</p>
        <h3 id="yeast">Yeast infections</h3>
        <p>Yeast infections are common in pregnancy. Still, it’s a good idea to contact your doctor for a proper diagnosis before treating it at home.
<br>
Safe medications include:
</p>
<ul class="page-list">
<li>Miconazole</li>
<li>Clotrimazole</li>
<li>Butoconazole</li>
</ul>
<p>
Home remedies and natural treatments are generally not recommended for yeast infections during pregnancy.
</p>
        <h3 id="allergy">Allergies</h3>
        <p>Mild allergies may respond well to lifestyle measures. If you need some extra help, the following OTC oral antihistamines are generally considered safe:
        </p>
        <ul class="page-list">
<li>Diphenhydramine</li>
<li>Chlorpheniramine</li>
<li>Loratadine</li>
</ul>

        <h3 id="insomnia"> Insomnia</h3>
        <p>
Safe medications for insomnia are those in the diphenhydramine (category B) family, including:
</p>
<ul class="page-list">
<li>Sominex</li>
<li>Nytol</li>
<li>Doxylamine succinate  is another possibility that may also be used if you’re experiencing insomnia.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If OTC methods don’t work, your doctor may prescribe the following after weighing the benefits and risks:
</p>
        <h3 id="heartburn">Heartburn</h3>
        <p>
OTC antacids containing alginic acid, aluminum, magnesium, and calcium are generally safe during pregnancy:
</p>
<ul class="page-list">

<li>Aluminum hydroxide-magnesium hydroxide</li>
<li>calcium carbonate</li>
<li>Simethicone</li>
<li>Famotidine</li>
</ul>
<p>
For severe heartburn, your doctor may suggest taking H2 blockers, such as:
</p>
<ul class="page-list">
<li>Ranitidine</li>
<li>Cimetidine</li>
</ul>
